A basic log generation simulator used for testing of log consumption devices.

Can be used to replicate any event log that contains, IP address, time, date, userid and transaction.

Eg. application access, firewalls, network devices, databases, directories and so on.

Provide a list of unique userid's and IP addresses, along with a file containining the resource transactions.

The application will iterate over the data files n-times over the start and end dates.

Output can then be pre-formatted into csv, tab, name-value pairs and so on.

Transactions should be randomized over the entire date range.

Released as-if no warranty.
